This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

## Requirements/Steps before build development server

1. Make sure your node version is high enough to run Angular Cli, mine is v6.9.0. You can use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to have different version of node installed on your machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the node packages
3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
4. Please search the keyword 'surf', some of the videos I have dummy user data set in file '/src/app/data/user-data.ts', feel free to change

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
